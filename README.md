# Features
## Machine Learning Models
- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

# Data Processing
- Feature selection and preprocessing
- Train-test split for evaluation
  
# Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report

# User Input Prediction

- Takes user input for transaction features
- Predicts if the transaction is fraudulent or not
  
# Dataset
- The dataset should be in CSV format (cdd.csv).
- The Class column is the target variable (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent).

# Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

# Dependencies

### Following are the major dependencies of the project:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib

# Prerequisites
- Python must be installed on the system.
- You should have the dataset (cdd.csv).
- A code editor (preferred: VS Code or Jupyter Notebook).

# Installation and Setup

1.Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Credit_card_fraud_detection
```
2.Install dependencies

3.Run the script:
```sh
python fraud_detection.py
```
# Usage
- Upload the dataset (cdd.csv).
- The script will train multiple machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
- The user can input transaction details for real-time fraud detection.
